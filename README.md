# Overview


# Preliminaries

The MapReduce part of the project is done based on 

# Sentiment Analysis with MapReduce 

Sentiment analysis jobs are done with MapReduce by extending the `Mapper` and `Reducer` classes imported from `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce ` as two classes, `SentimentSplit` and `SentimentCollection` for the mapping and reducing of the analysis. See the _SentimentAnalysis.java_ for more details.
